There were very few resources for me to learn about this field from. I decided to start making YouTube videos to share my experiences and to help others learn about data science, machine learning, and AI. \n\nOn this channel I produce fun and informative Data Science content. My goal is to make this field more acessible to everyone through commentary, tutorial, and other educational videos. \n\nI\\'ve been working in the data science field doing sports analytics for the last 7 years. I\\'ve held data science positions in companies ranging from startups to fortune 100 organizations.  Hopefully my experience will be valuable to you! \n\nCheck out my podcast \"Ken\\'s Nearest Neighbors\" for some great interviews with the best in the field!\n\n",
